### 🎯 About Me

I'm an enthusiastic frontend developer who started programming 9 months ago. Around 7 months ago, I discovered the world of frontend development — and I loved it. Since then, I haven’t stopped learning.

I enjoy building beautiful, functional, and fast websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Astro**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Currently, I’m learning **React**, **SQL**, and **Next.js** because I want to keep growing and eventually become a **full-stack developer**.

I’m very curious, self-taught, and passionate about every project I build. I love helping others, sharing what I learn, and collaborating with teams.
